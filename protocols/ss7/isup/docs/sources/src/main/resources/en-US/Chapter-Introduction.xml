	<para>
		The ISDN User Part (ISUP) is a protocol used to set-up, manage, and release trunk circuits and
		carry voice data between terminating line exchanges (for example, between a calling party and a
		called party).
  </para>
  <para>
		ISUP is used for both ISDN and non-ISDN calls. However, calls that originate and terminate at the same switch do not use ISUP signaling.
	</para>
	<para>
		ISUP is defined in ITU-T <literal>Q.763</literal> specification.
	</para>
	<para>ISUP supercedes TUP (Telephony User Part) as the standard for
		call control between telephone exchanges.</para>
