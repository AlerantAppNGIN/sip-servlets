	<title>Introduction

	</title>
	<para>
		SCCP provides connectionless and connection-oriented network
		services
		and global title translation (GTT) capabilities above
		<acronym>MTP</acronym>
		Level 3. SCCP provides also extended routing, flow control,
		segmentation and reassembly of data service.
	</para>
	<para>
		A global title is an address (e.g., a dialed 800 number,
		calling card
		number, or mobile subscriber identification number)
		which is translated
		by SCCP into a destination point code and
		subsystem number. A subsystem
		number uniquely identifies an
		application at the destination signaling
		point.
		<acronym>SCCP</acronym>
		is used as the
		transport layer for
		<acronym>TCAP</acronym>
		-based services
	</para>
	<para>
		As its main purpose is to route data units between signaling nodes, it
		requires means of configuring routing directives.
		This
		<acronym>CLI</acronym>
		provides way to easly manage routing information in &THIS.PLATFORM;
		<acronym>SCCP</acronym>
		implementation.
