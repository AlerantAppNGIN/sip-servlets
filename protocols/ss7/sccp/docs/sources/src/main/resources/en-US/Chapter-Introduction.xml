	<para>
		SCCP provides connectionless and connection-oriented network
		services and global title translation (GTT) capabilities above
		MTP
		Level 3. SCCP also provides extended routing, flow control, segmentation and reassembly of data services.
		</para>
		<para>A global title is an address (for example, a dialed 800 number,
		calling card number, or mobile subscriber identification number)
		that is translated by SCCP into a destination point code and
		subsystem number. A subsystem number uniquely identifies an
		application at the destination signaling point.
		SCCP
		is used as the
		transport layer for
		TCAP
		-based services
	</para>
	<para>
		SCCP
		data is sent between peers by means of Data Units (UDs).
