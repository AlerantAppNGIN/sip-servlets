= CDI Telco Framework

CDI is the Java standard for dependency injection and contextual lifecycle management, led by Gavin King for Red Hat, Inc.
and is a Java Community Process(JCP) specification that integrates cleanly with the Java EE platform.
Any Java EE 6-compliant application server provides support for JSR-299 (even the web profile). It seemed a natural fit create a new framework based on CDI for the Telco world.

CDI-Telco-Framework (CTF) from Restcomm brings the power and productivity benefits of CDI into the Restcomm Sip Servlets platform providing dependency injection and contextual lifecycle management for converged HTTP/SIP applications.
This new framework is intended to become a replacement for our previous Seam Telco Framework.

CTF mission statement is to simplify SipServlets development by introducing a component based programming model, ease of development by making available SIP utilities out of the box, and finally providing dependency injection and contextual lifecycle management to the SipServlets.
