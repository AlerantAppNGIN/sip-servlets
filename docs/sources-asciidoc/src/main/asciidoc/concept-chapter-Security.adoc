= Security

The information present in SIP requests often contains sensitive user information.
To protect user information, SIP Security can be enabled on the server, and within the SIP application to mitigate the risk of unauthorised access to the information.

There are essentially two levels of security that can be enabled on the server, the communication between the server and other SIP entities and securing the application and its content.
